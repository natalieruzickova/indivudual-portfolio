# CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION USING RFM ANALYSIS AND K-MEANS CLUSTERING

This project contains a complete workflow for a university project focused on customer segmentation using RFM analysis and K-Means clustering, beginning with data loading and cleaning of the Online Retail II dataset, followed by preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, removing cancellations, and computing transaction totals; it then constructs Recency, Frequency, and Monetary variables, scales them for consistency, evaluates different cluster counts through the elbow method and silhouette scores, applies the final K-Means model to segment customers, and concludes with visualizations and interpretations of the resulting clusters to provide actionable insights into customer behavior.
